data <- tbl_df(read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv")))
head(data)

```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
data <- tbl_df(read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv")))
stepdata <- data %>% 
     group_by(date) %>% 
     summarize(total_steps = sum(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
head(stepdata)
hist(stepdata$total_steps, 
     breaks=20, 
     main="Total Daily Steps", 
     xlab="Total Number of Steps Per Day",
     col="blue")
mn <- mean(stepdata$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
md <- median(stepdata$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
rbind(mean=mn, median = md)

```

## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
